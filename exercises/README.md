## 001 New Hire orientation
In this example we are going to do a quick overview of the environment we set up in this tutorial. We'll walk through the basic container paradigms and briefly touch on how to and why you would want to manage a local containerized develpment enviornment.

## 002 Your First Day On the Job
It's your first day on the job, you are a new developer on an existing software product. We're going to get you set up to write some code and make commits on your first day.

You're going to update the environment to add mysql so that a migration can occur. Let's talk about container networking, and how we can emulate complex distributed platforms with simple configuration files.

## 004 The Unoperational Operating System
Now that you have added a new database to your development environment you've run in to some problems connecting to the new database from your application. After tracking the issue down to a library in your linux distribution you've decided it will be easier to swap out the entire operating system for something with better support. Let's talk about container and image portability and what that means for helping manage change in large software ecosystems.

## 005  The Big Red Button
