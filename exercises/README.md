## 001 New Hire orientation
In this example we are going to do a quick overview of the environment we set up in this tutorial. We'll walk through the basic container paradigms and briefly touch on how to and why you would want to manage a local containerized development environment.

## 002 Your First Day On the Job
It's your first day on the job, you are a new developer on an existing software product. We're going to get you set up to write some code and make commits on your first day.

## 003 You're here to help
You were happy to get up to speed so quickly, but you wouldn't be you if you weren't already trying to make changes. Let's talk about some adjustments that can make containerized development more manageable. 

## 004 The Data Dilemma
It turns out you had a really good first day and your CTO just showed up with a with a pet project. It turns out that she doesn't like that we are using Redis as a primary data store, NoSQL databases were all the rage a couple years ago, but it's time to use a "real" database. You're going to update the environment to add mysql so that a migration can occur. Let's talk about container networking, and how we can emulate complex distributed platforms with simple configuration files.

## 005 The Unoperational Operating System
Now that you have added a new database to your development environment you've run in to some problems connecting to the new database from your application. After tracking the issue down to a library in your linux distribution you've decided it will be easier to swap out the entire operating system for something with better support. Let's talk about container and image portability and what that means for helping manage change in large software ecosystems.

## 006  The Big Red Button
A lot of organizations are reducing what used to be complex deployments down to what amounts to a button push. You've moved mountains in your first week on the job and now we need to deploy to a staging environment. Let's talk about what software delivery looks like on containerized delivery platforms.
